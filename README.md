### Instructions

The main Mathematica notebook `chaotic_ecosystem_code.nb` contains sections necessary to regenerate each result and figure in the manuscript "A phase transition induces chaos in a predator-prey ecosystem with a dynamic fitness landscape"

If using any of these results or code, please cite:

	William Gilpin and Marcus W. Feldman. "Numerical calculation of Lyapunov exponents." (under revision) 2017



### Dependencies

This code calls several Mathematica routines that were written by previous authors. If using a portion of the code that calls one of these routines, please credit the original source, and cite their accompanying paper:

`IceFork.m` is a minor modification of [M. Sandri's "Ice.m" Mathematica package for computing Lyapunov exponents](http://www.msandri.it/soft.html). If using this portion of the code, please cite the original paper:

	Marco Sandri. "Numerical calculation of Lyapunov exponents." Mathematica Journal 6.3 (1996): 78-84.



`RootSearch.m` was originally written by [Ted Ersek](http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Demos/4482/)


`DivergentColorMap.m` was originally written by [Jason D. Biggs](https://github.com/jasondbiggs/DivergentColorMaps)
